![FatherBoard Logo](https://cs2team24.cs2410-web01pvm.aston.ac.uk/images/front_images/FatherboardBackground.png)

FatherBoard was founded in 2024 by 9 Computer Science students.
Our goal is to provide reasonably priced PC parts to hobbyists, fanatics and professionals alike.

As students, we understand the difficulty in finding appropriately priced computer parts, and how these prices create a high barrier to entry. This means that many individuals interesed in PC building, cannot reasonably access the hobby.

We wanted to fix this, and share our enjoyment of PC parts and PC building.


# Some Features:
FatherBoard features a state-of-the-art questionnaire feature, which provides users with guidance on what PC parts would be the best for their build. This aims to lower the barrier of entry to PC building, and make it more accessible. 
Consumers can contact the site admins by using the built in contact form. This may be regarding general questions, or site issues.
The admin page for FatherBoard provides records regarding customer purchases, registered users and items in stock, allowing the admins to easily manage products and gain insights to customer interests.
FatherBoard has implemented a Jenkins pipeline system to allow for automatic updates when any new code is pushed to the main branch, ensuring that the live server is regularly, and reliably, updated.

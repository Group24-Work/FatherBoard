            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <br>

            <p style="text-align: left;">FatherBoard was founded in 2024 by 9 Computer Science students. <br>
                Our goal is to provide reasonably priced PC parts to hobbyists, fanatics and professionals alike.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                As students, we understand the difficulty in finding appropriately priced computer parts, and how these
                prices create a high barrier to entry.
                This means that many individuals interesed in PC building, cannot reasonably access the hobby.
                <br>
                <br>
                We wanted to fix this, and share our enjoyment of PC parts and PC building.
                <br>
                <br>
                At FatherBoard, we believe in transparent communication. If you have any issues or queries, please <a
